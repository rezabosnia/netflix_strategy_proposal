The rise of short-form video content caused by TikTok and Reels offer opportuniyy for Netflix to enhance viewer experience and gain more subscriber. In this project, we did a survey and analyze the result using regression analysis. We found out that there's a statistically significant correlation of implementing short-form video content to enhanced viewer experience
